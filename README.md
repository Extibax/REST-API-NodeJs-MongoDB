# REST-API-NodeJs-MongoDB
This is a REST API with NodeJs as Back-End and MongoDB as Data Base

## Description
This is a REST API with NodeJs as Back-End and MongoDB as Data Base, This APi is compatible with many browsers, Because I use Babel to Transpiler/Compiler JavaScript, And if you want test this follow the next steps:

### If you don't have installed NodeJs & npm, Install here: https://nodejs.org/en/
### Step 1: Install all dependencies of the project:
```npm
npm install
```
### Step 2: Run the server:
```npm
npm start
```
## If you want run the development code, You need install devDependencies, So run:
```npm
npm install --production
```
### After run
```npm
npm run dev
```

## I recommend you use Postman: https://www.getpostman.com/ or Insomnia: https://insomnia.rest/ to fetch the API
