## Description
This is a REST API with NodeJs as Back-End and MongoDB as Data Base, This APi is compatible with many browsers, Because I use Babel to Transpiler/Compiler JavaScript, And if you want test this follow the next steps:

#### If you don't have installed NodeJs & npm, Install here: https://nodejs.org/en/

```npm

#### Info: The connection to MongoDB have to ways: The first is a connection to MongoDB Atlas (Remote) or to MongoDB local (localhost), If you don't have the DB_USER & DB_PASS environment variables, The connection automaticaly connecto to the localhost MongoDB
#### I recommend you use Postman: https://www.getpostman.com/ or Insomnia: https://insomnia.rest/ to fetch the API
